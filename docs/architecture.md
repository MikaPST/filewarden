# Architecture proposal

WordPress PHP plugin with modular services: DocumentService, PermissionService, StorageService, AuditService. Admin interface may use WordPress React components; public interface should remain lightweight.

Data tables (subject to detailed schema review): documents, folders, versions, permissions, audit_logs, download_stats, displays. WordPress prefix is dynamic.

REST namespace proposal: `/wp-json/filewarden/v1` for metadata and mutations. Binary routes require browser-compatible WordPress authentication, support PDF range requests where appropriate, and enforce ACL per request.

Storage abstraction should support local private storage initially and allow S3/MinIO in a future release. Security verification is fail-closed, including when storage is moved or server configuration changes.

No document storage, ACL, or download implementation exists yet.
